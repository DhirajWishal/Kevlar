## How to build and run

Before we prepare for the build, make sure to have the following dependencies,

1. [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). We prefer sticking to the latest version.
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Again, we prefer the latest version.
3. [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) python module.

First things first, clone this repository to a local directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhirajWishal/Kevlar {SOURCE}
cd {SOURCE}
```

*Where source means the directory where the repository is cloned to.*

Once cloned, you need to open up the `/client` folder in [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), and the `/server` project in [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
From there on, you first need to run the server project, then the client application.
