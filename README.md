## How to build

Before we prepare for the build, make sure to have the following dependencies,

1. [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). We prefer sticking to the latest version.
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Again, we prefer the latest version.

First things first, clone this repository to a local directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhirajWishal/Kevlar {SOURCE}
cd {SOURCE}
```

*Where source means the directory where the repository is cloned to.*

From there, you need to run the `Main.js` file from the `server/` directory, and the `Main.java` file under the `client/` directory. If everything was successful, you proceed with logging in or by creating a new
account.
